This is the repo of my personal portfolio.

The app is developed in React and CSS. There are 3 main sections: Profile, Projects and Contact. Profile shows information about me and my experience. Projects shows the latest projects I have worked on. Contact shows links to my social networks profiles and a form to send me e-mails directly.

This website was made to show potential employers or partners the kind of work I do.

To have the project you just need to clone the repo in your computer and npm install
